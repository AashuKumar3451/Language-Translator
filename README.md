# üåê Multilingual Neural Machine Translation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing multiple deep learning models for machine translation, including:
- **Urdu ‚Üí English** (LSTM-based Seq2Seq)
- **English ‚Üí French** (Transformer)
- **French ‚Üí English** (Transformer)
- **English ‚Üí Urdu** (LSTM-based Seq2Seq)

The project demonstrates how to translate across low-resource and high-resource language pairs using encoder-decoder and attention-based architectures.

## üß† Models Included

- ‚úÖ **Model 1:** Urdu ‚Üí English (Bidirectional LSTM Encoder ‚Üí LSTM Decoder)
- ‚úÖ **Model 2:** English ‚Üí French (Transformer using Multi-head Attention)
- ‚úÖ **Model 3:** French ‚Üí English (Standard Seq2Seq LSTM)
- ‚úÖ **Model 4:** English ‚Üí French (Transformer using Multi-head Attention)

All models are implemented and evaluated within a single notebook for reproducibility and easier comparison.
